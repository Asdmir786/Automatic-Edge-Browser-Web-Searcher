Project Rule System
====================

1. Use Latest Modern Practices:
   - The agent must use the most modern coding practices, leveraging .NET 9 features and APIs throughout the code.

2. No Unauthorized Code Changes:
   - The agent will only change or modify code when explicitly requested. All modifications will be clearly explained and validated with the user first.

3. Consistent Recommendations:
   - All suggestions and implementations will adhere to modern coding standards, ensuring maintainability and scalability.

4. Automation & Best Practices:
   - The project will incorporate best practices for automation (e.g., using Selenium WebDriver for browser automation) and ensure a clean, single-origin structure.

5. Minimal Dependencies:
   - The project will avoid unnecessary changes or additional libraries unless they improve efficiency or readability and are specifically requested.

6. Transparency in Decision-Making:
   - Every design and architectural decision will be shared with the user for approval before implementation.
