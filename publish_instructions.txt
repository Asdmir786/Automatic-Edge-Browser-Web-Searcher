# How to Build a Standalone EXE for Automatic Edge Browser Web Searcher

1. Open PowerShell in your project directory.
2. Run the following command:

```
dotnet publish -c Release -r win-x64 --self-contained true /p:PublishSingleFile=true
```

- The output .exe will be in:
  `bin\Release\net9.0\win-x64\publish\`
- You only need the .exe file to run the program (queries are embedded).

## Notes
- No need to distribute queries.txt; it is built into the .exe.
- You can copy the .exe to any Windows machine and run it from cmd or by double-clicking.
- If you update queries.txt, rebuild the project to embed the new queries.
